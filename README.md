## Galaga Remake

A remake of the classic arcade game Galaga, built with Unity!

This project uses custom 2D sprites and features unique movement controls. The controls include WASD for movement and left mouse click to shoot. Your goal is to survive for as long as possible while dodging asteroids and shooting enemies that swarm you.
#### Power-ups:
- **Blue** - extra speed
- **Orange** - extra firepower
- **Green** - extra health

#### Small Bug / Easter Egg:
Clicking shoot while the game is paused will still fire bullets. You can use this to stack bullets which will fire when you unpause the game.
